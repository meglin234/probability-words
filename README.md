Paper Abstract:

Words of Estimative Probability (WEPs) are terms, such as “frequently” and “likely”, used to convey the likelihood of an event. In their most general use, the ambiguity of these phrases is not a problem, however, in sectors where clarity and precision are crucial, they can lead to misunderstanding. The Intelligence Community has made several attempts to standardize a paradigm for WEPs, although there has been little progress. Additionally, the use of WEPs in other fields has not been thoroughly investigated; there is no current literature on the use of WEPs in academic writing. This paper takes a first step at exploring the frequency with which WEPs occur in academic text. A subset of PubMed Central journal articles related to Educational Psychology were tokenized for analysis. The results suggest that WEPs are not frequently used in academic text; however, when and how they are used goes unexplored. Future applications include exploring text from various industries, the implications of WEPs on psychology’s replication crisis, using vector embeddings to provide insight into context, and predictive modeling to assign numerical values to WEPs.
